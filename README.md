# leaflet: Visualising Data with Leaflet
Visualising Data with Leaflet

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualise their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Summary:
A JSON of all Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days was used to pull in the data for the visualisations. A map was created using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by colour. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in colour.

Popups were included on the map which provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked. A legend was alos created that provides context for the map data.
